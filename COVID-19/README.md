# COVID19 Forecasting

![Confirmed Cases](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63497499/84279778-123fe000-ab54-11ea-819f-4547d92b07cc.png)

Forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between March 25 and April 22 by region, the primary goal isn't to produce accurate forecasts. Itâ€™s to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.

We will be predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID19 cases in various locations across the world, as well as the number of resulting fatalities, for future dates. Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental 
institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold.
